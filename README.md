# Weight-Converter

A weight converter made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  The original one comes from brad traversy, which can found here at this [link.](https://codepen.io/bradtraversy/pen/jGNWey)  The main difference is that it has all the other forms of weight measurements added to it. It converts pounds(lbs) into grams, kilograms, ounces,  milligrams, metric ton, micrograms, imperial ton, US ton, and stone.



This was made using bootstrap and pure vanilla Javascript.  You can find a live demonstration of the project here at this [link.](https://codepen.io/mantiereid/full/mZVoqo) The source code is also available on codepen.  Which you can find here, at this [link.](https://codepen.io/mantiereid/pen/mZVoqo)
